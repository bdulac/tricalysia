As the dial hand tells o'er

The same hours it had before,



Still beginning in the ending,

Circular account still lending,



So, most mighty Queen we pray,

Like the dial day by day



You may lead the seasons on,

Making new when old are gone,



That the babe which now is young

And hath yet no use of tongue



Many a Shrovetide here may bow

To that empress I do now,



That the children of these lords,

Sitting at your council boards,



May be grave and aged seen

Of her that was their fathers' queen.



Once I wish this wish again,

Heaven subscribe it with "Amen".
